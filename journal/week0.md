### Install AWS CLI

I was not able to use gitpod or github codespaces due to browser issues.
So I decided to use a local environment.

Inorder to prove that I am able to use the AWS CLI.
I am providing the instructions I used for my configuration of my local machine on windows.

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI.

I installed the AWS CLI via command in **Command Prompt**:

```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```

I attempted to run the command by typing in `aws` but I received an error

```

C:\Users\Andrew>aws
'aws' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
Operable program or batch file.
```

I was able to resolve the error by closing command prompt, and opening it again.
